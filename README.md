# AI Project
# Description
Model building in Google Colab , using KNN model to classification
 5 flowers. Training data is taken in the Kaggle with more 4000 images and
 testing data our take in the website. Then Using OpenCv to read and process.
 Position: Research, build and adjust the quantity of the model.
# Using KNN to classify flowers
## About this model
Language python.
Library: numpy, pandas, matplotlib, sklearn, cv2, glod, os, imutils.
Environment: Google Colab

In model, we will use KNN model to classify 5 types of flowers: daisy, dandelion, rose, sunflower, tulip.
# Note 

You should setting the path correct before running the code.

# Setting and run code
+ Step 1: Download folder model in github.
+ Step 2: Push folder in Google Colab.
+ Step 3: Run code in file KNN_Model_code.ipynb.
